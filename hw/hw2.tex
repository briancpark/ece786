\section*{1. C.8}

In this exercise, we analyze how the instructions of a Vector-Add kernel function run on SIMT pipelines. The following is the instruction sequence in the PTX format:

ld.global.f32   %f1, [%r14+0]    //f1 = mem[r14+0]
ld.global.f32   %f2, [%r16+0]    //f2 = mem[r16 + 0]
add.f32           %f3, %f1, %f2   // f3 = f1 + f2
st.global.f32   [%r18+0], %f3    // mem[r18 + 0] = f3 

Using the pipeline timing diagram to show how these instructions are executed on one SM. The following assumptions are made: 

(1) the SM has 16 SPs

(2) the load/store latency is 5 cycles (i.e., 5 MEM stages) with AGEN included in the 5 stages, and the add latency is 3 cycles (i.e., 3 EX stages)

(3) the SM can run 6 warps concurrently and the warp scheduling policy is round robin

(4) there is no scoreboard to support more than 1 instruction from the same warp to be issued to the pipeline. 

(5) IF and ID are 2 cycles each

(6) WB can handle 16 threads at a time.

How many cycles does it take to execute all the 6 warps, counting from when the first instruction enters the IF stage to when the last instruction enters the WB stage?
